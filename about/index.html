          <img src="/images/about/My_Headshot4-150x203.png" alt="About Me The Designer & Developer" class="about_image">
          <p>I started my design career early in my life, drawing every chance I got. Being an artist is a large part of my life as a personal hobby. I realized I wanted to be a designer and devloper early in high school. I decided to take every art and development class that was available to me to get as much experience as I could to prepare myself for college. After high school I went college hunting and decided to plant myself at Robert Morris University in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh. I finished my four year with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree with a concentration in web design and development. During college I got the opportunity to intern at a 14 year old non- profit screen printing organization called the Artists Image Resource (<a target="_blank" title="Artist Image Resource Site" href="http://www.artistsimageresource.org/">AIR Website</a>). I was able to learn a lot of different printing processes that I wasn't privy to while at school. I was in charge of preparing designs for print as well as working with large groups of the team at AIR to actually make the prints that kept the studio running. I even was given the opportunity to design and develop their website which over the years has been changed and no longer really resembles the site I developed although some of it still exists.</p>
          <p>After college I was ready to get my design feet wet and landed my first job at Albertsgifts.com which was a promotional product company in downtown Pittsburgh. By no means was it a dream job, but I realized you have to be really lucky to start out big. I designed a lot of products at this job, but it was mostly placing logos on pens and other random objects. I was able to design products that were really interesting like bobble head dolls and custom mugs, but where I was really allowed to let my creativity flow was in the weekly flier designs. Albert's Gifts sent these fliers to all of their resellers around the country. Products came in by the hundreds. Sometimes I had to photograph the products, clean them up, cut out the images, design the flier and get them printed within one day. In my year at Albert's I probably designed over 300 different fliers.</p>
          <p>My next job landed me in Albany, NY at <a target="_blank" title="Overit Media Site" href="http://overit.com/">Overit Media</a>, a multimedia development company. At this job I was given the responsibility of a web and print designer, web developer, and flash developer. I gained a lot of experience with working directly with clients. All jobs were based on an hourly system meaning that when the client signed a contract they were given an approximate hourly length of time that it would take to complete the project. When a project was contracted, I would work with the client to make sure that the process from beginning to end would deliver exact expectations.</p>
          <p>Also while working at Overit I was contracted by my company to work for Vicarious Visions a video game development company (<a target="_blank" title="Vicarious Visions Website" href="http://www.vvisions.com/">Vicarious Website</a>). At Vicarious I was in charge of user interface design and development of games including Guitar Hero 5, Band Hero, and Guitar Hero 6 for the <span style="font-style: italic;">Wii</span> console game system. Although contracted out to Vicarious I continued completeing work for Overit Media after normal work hours.</p>
          <p>My current position resides at <a target="_blank" href="http://informatics-studio.com">Informatics Studio</a>, a graphic design and development studio located in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania where it is our goal through design and development to effectively organize and present informational data in any form of media. My role at Informatics is primarily as Lead Developer where i head the development of projects and manage a team of developers to complete those projects for the studio. My role in the studio also extends into server setup and administration for our clients and the studio.</p>
          <p>My responsibility as lead developer is to make sure that all of the developers in my team are adhering to the software quality standards agreed by my team and the wider development team so that work is done to the highest possible quality. I also need to understand and be able to talk about and explain to my team the importance of principles of good design and development so that we are able to produce digital solutions of the highest possible quality in the fastest possible time. I need to act as example to all the developers on my team by being the person who most closely follows the principles and practices we have committed to so that the developers on my team feel confident they can too. I need to also set a good example to all the developers on my team by advocating learning and taking the time to do so myself so that they feel comfortable they can too. While maintaining my leadership position I also make it a point to work with my fellow developers as we are all at the same level, meaning taking their suggestions and having profitable discussions as a group to mould the way the development team progresses. I never in my position want to make my fellow developers feel that I am a nasty dictator. Keeping these things in mind, I believe it only promots a healthy and efficient team.</p>
          <p>As a developer at Informatics Studio I have developed many site and web applications for national and international communication programs for clients that include the United Nations Development Programme, the US Institute of Peace, the US Department of State, the National Council for Science and the Environment, the African Center for Economic Development, the Inter- American Development Bank, the National Institutes of Health, National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Department of Health and Human Services, US Department of Education, US Department of Commerce, and the US Department of Homeland Security.</p>
          <p>I've been keeping myself really busy gaining a variety of experiences in multiple fields of design and development. I give a lot of credit to not only myself for my experience but also to the talented people I've had the chance to work with for the past few years. So I give thanks to those who took me under their wings and helped me to become the designer and developer I am today and continue striving to become. It is a tough field of work, but I believe I am right where I should be in my life and couldn't be happier.</p>

          <h3 class="section_title"><span>About Me: Personal</span></h3>
          <img src="/images/about/cartoon_headshot2.png" alt="About Me Personal" class="about_image">
          <p>To talk a little about myself, I stem from a long line of artistic people. My grandmother loved art; my aunt and father both loved to draw; I also believe my great grandmother was an artist. I feel that even in my current possition as a developer, I still am an artist at heart but the only difference is that I paint with code. Although I am a developer professionally, I still like to occasionaly use my Fine Arts degree in my own personal time as a hobby.</p>
          <p>Other than the artistic and nerdy side of me, I would have to say that I'm a huge fan of watching and playing hockey. I played all sports as a young kid including baseball and soccer, but my heart definitely lies with hockey. I've played hockey since I was 7 years old with my position of choice being goaltender. I kind of chose my goalie position and I kind of didn't. What I mean by this is that I have two other brothers that loved to play hockey as well but the unfortunate thing was that someone had to be the goalie. Either way I was happy with my choice, but my mother wasn't too excited about it because it meant that she had to shell out thousands of dollars for the equipment for me to play. THANKS MOM! If I didn't have hockey in my life I don't think I would survive. When I'm not playing myself, I, of course as a former resident of the Pittsburgh area, am a huge fan of the Pittsburgh Penguins. LET'S GO PENS!</p>
          <p>In 2014 I got married to the most wonderful and beautiful girl in the world. She makes every day worth waking up for. Without her by my side I know that I would have not made it through a lot in my life... without going insane. She is my rock and I love her with all my heart. I am just amazed that she sticks with me, with my goofy personality and job that makes me work until 3am for days on end from time to time. LOVE YOU LINZ!</p>
          <p>That's just a little about me, but not everything. I tend to think of myself as multidimensional, meaning that I'm not into just one thing. I love doing just about anything as long as I'm enjoying life with the ones I love and care about. I believe that is the most important thing of all.</p>

          <h3 class="section_title"><span>About: Onfire Designs</span></h3>
          <img src="/images/about/onfire_Headshot.png" alt="Onfire Designs Photo" class="about_image">
          <p>Onfire Designs has been around since my college days. It has been through many revisions. It started as just a site for me to practice my PHP development for college homework but has grown into a full blown portfolio site for myself. The first few revisions of the site were laughable in the way they were designed and developed. It has taken me a while to hone my skills to build the site you see today. The last revision of the site was a table based layout which I did in 2005. I was so happy to rip that one apart and take it down.</p>
          <p>In this current site I decided to explore some things I never did because I used either someone else's plugins or code. Everything you see from the design to development have all been designed and coded by me from scratch using Jekyll and github pages. The reason I did this is because I didn't want to pay to host my site (WIN) and to attempt to use a technology that I have never used before.</p>
          <p>I hope that as you read this you have enjoyed my work and my site. Feel free to stick around, have a drink and check out my <a target="" title="Onfire Portfolio" href="//portfolio">portfolio</a>.</p>
